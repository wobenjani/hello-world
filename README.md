# hello-world

using a guide to get used to this whole github business.

i'm new to all this and i am very unfamiliar with how github works and what its for.
i have been watching coding train videos and reading a book to learn P5.js.
i hope to become very good at coding and eventually build AI systems as a hobby.

anyone that can help is very much appreciated.
